      question: "How does PortersPrep's pricing work?",
      answer: "We offer three tiers: Free (1 assessment/month, 1 essay, 3 redlines), Plus ($49/month for 3 assessments, 5 essays, 20 redlines), and Pro ($199/month for unlimited assessments, 20 essays, 100 redlines). All plans include coach messaging and consultation sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you write essays for me?",
      answer: "No. We coach; you write. Our AI provides feedback and suggestions to improve your writing, but we never write essays for you. This ensures your voice and authenticity shine through in your application."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the school likelihood assessments?",
      answer: "Our assessments are based on historical data and current admissions trends, but they're estimates, not guarantees. Many factors influence admissions decisions, and we provide likelihood bands rather than exact percentages."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes your coaches qualified?",
      answer: "Our coaches are experienced MBA admissions consultants with backgrounds in top business schools. They understand the application process, essay requirements, and what admissions committees look for in candidates."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you protect my privacy and data?",
      answer: "We take data security seriously. All personal information and essays are encrypted, and we never share your data with third parties. You can request deletion of your data at any time."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use PortersPrep for multiple school applications?",
      answer: "Yes! Your subscription covers multiple school applications. Each assessment is school-specific, and you can create separate essays for different programs within your plan's limits."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I exceed my plan's limits?",
      answer: "You'll receive a notification when approaching your limits. You can upgrade your plan at any time to get more assessments, essays, or redlines. We also offer one-time purchases for additional usage."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get started?",
      answer: "Simply sign up for a free account and start with your first assessment. Upload your resume, tell us about your goals, and we'll provide personalized school recommendations and strategy."
